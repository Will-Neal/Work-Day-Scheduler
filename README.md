Under the hood is some useful functionality. The timer serves double duty and also serves to tell the application which hour blocks are current, past and present and to color them accordingly. Tasks in the past also have a line through them as if crossed out, leaving them legible but distinguishing them from tasks that still need to be accomplished in the present and future. The save button saves the users input in local storage and saves it even if they refresh or close the window or even their browser. Lastly there is a button to clear the scheduler by clearing the local storage and refreshing the page, leaving the user with a completely clean slate.
